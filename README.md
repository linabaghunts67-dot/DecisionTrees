# Decision Tree Classifier in Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using Python's scikit-learn library. Decision trees are a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively splitting the data based on feature values to make predictions.

## Project Structure

- `decision_tree_classifier.py`: Contains the implementation of the decision tree classifier.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation

Clone the repository:
